== SIT - Getting Started with the Docker Maven Plugin

=== Overview

Below:

* TL;DR = Quick Start with major components and boilerplate snippets
* After that is more depth.
* Also, see the source code under the project folder for a minimal, fully-functional example.

*NOTE* this project does not include any containers with System dependencies (e.g. DB, JMS, etc) for the application.

=== What's the Opposite of TL;DR?

image::./assets/3rdparty/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3790797.jpg[]

There is a good amount of boiler-plate to get started with the Docker Maven Plugin,
and some gotchas.

Here we cover the basics, provide an example, and discuss the basics of the example
which can be used as a template for your own projects.

Note that this article specifically covers the use of the `docker-maven-plugin` and
not the use of the alternative with `Test Containers`.
The main advantages of the plugin over test containers include:

* Maven lifecycle support:
** the plugin creates and starts up the test containers during maven's `pre-integration-test` https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html[phase]
** it shuts down and removes the containers during maven's `post-integration-test` https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html[phase]
** all integration tests execute between those two phases, during the `integration-test` https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html[phase]
* Fairly direct translation from the plugin config to Dockerfile / Docker Compose

*NOTE* a notable disadvantage of the plugin is a lack of cleanup if the Maven build itself is interrupted.
See the section below on "Cleanup after Interrupted Tests" for more information.


=== Multi-Module Project Structure

While it is possible to use the `docker-maven-plugin` in a single-module project,
doing so makes the POM harder to read,
and can complicate the flow.
This author is a huge fan of modularity, within reason,
and strongly advocates for the use of a multi-module project here.

The structure of the example project:

* Parent
** Main
** Docker-IT


==== Parent POM

Links together the entire project through Maven modules:

[,xml,linenum]
----
include::./project/pom.xml[tag=parent-modules-decl,indent=0]
----

The parent is also a great place for the following,
although it is not demonstrated in this example project:

* Defining common versions of dependencies to use across the entire project
* Defining common versions, and configuration, for plugins used across the entire project
* Defining common profiles and/or build properties to support build parameters (e.g. skipping tests)


==== Main JAR

The entire demo application is contained in this one JAR file
using the spring-boot-maven-plugin to generate an "executable jar" file.

Included in this example project is a web service with a simple endpoint
that returns a fixed response with the text `Hello`
served at the path `/api/hi`.

To view the code, please see the TL;DR section above for a quick overview,
or view the full code itself under the project folder.
Here are links to the full code of the Main module:

===== Generating the Executable JAR

Below is the section of the `pom.xml` in the Main module
that packages the JAR file into an "executable jar".

[,xml,linenum]
----
include::./project/main/pom.xml[tag=spring-boot-maven-plugin,indent=0]
----

Note the use of the ZIP layout - this enables deployments to easily add
to the executions class path through environment variables or
system properties.
Adding to the classpath enhances support for externalized configuration.
Here's an example using an environment variable to add to the class path:

[,bash]
----
$ LOADER_PATH="/opt/application/config"
$ export LOADER_PATH
$ java -jar ...
----


==== Docker IT

Here are the key parts for the System Tests:

* creation of a test container for the application
* instructions to spin up and shut down test containers
* test code itself
* handling errors reported by the tests

Please see the TL;DR section above for a quick overview of the code,
or view the full code itself under the project folder.
Here are links to the full code of the Main module:

* link:https://github.com/savoirtech/black-box-system-test-dmp/blob/main/project/docker-it/pom.xml[pom.xml]
* link:https://github.com/savoirtech/black-box-system-test-dmp/blob/main/project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/HelloIT.java[HelloIT.java]


[#creation-of-a-test-container-for-the-application]
==== Creation of a Test Container for the Application

Applications may or may not require a docker container to be created as a product of the build.
This example excludes a separate image as a product of the build,
and instead creates a test-specific image only.

Here is the *from* definition for the container.
For this example, a simple Java-based container is all we need.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=application-test-image-build-from]
----

A subtle, but valuable part of the image creation here uses the `maven-dependency-plugin`
to copy the main JAR into the `docker-it` project's target folder.
While it is feasible to directly link to the JAR file in the main sub-module's folder,
there are cases where that is not the right JAR file to use,
or where the JAR file may not be there.
Note that we're talking about an edge-case here, but it can happen
and when it does, it can create significant confusion
due to the wrong version of the project main JAR running in the test.

Using the maven dependency plugin, we ensure that Maven gives us the correct
version of the JAR file based on the way the developer runs the build.
For example, when running a full build from the parent folder,
maven builds the main JAR, attaches it to the build,
and then the dependency plugin picks up
that version of the JAR.
On the other hand, if the developer runs a build from the `docker-it` module
folder itself (not using `-pl` arguments),
then maven will use the version of the main JAR file from the developer's `~/.m2/repository` cache.

There are more combinations and possible outcomes here.
There's even the case of testing against a released version of the main JAR file,
downloaded from Maven Central (or other release repository).
The safe advice for new developers is to always run the full build from the parent folder
while developing and testing your local code.
Please feel free to discuss further on the Github discussion pages for this project.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=maven-dependency-plugin-copy-main-jar]
----


And here we tell the Docker Maven Plugin
to add our main project JAR file into the docker image under the directory `/app`,
using the dependency extracted by the `maven-dependency-plugin`.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=application-test-image-assembly]
----

The `<entryPoint>` tag contains the instructions for starting the application
at container startup time.
Note the command is

[,bash,linenum,indent=0]
----
java -Dloader.path=/app/config -jar /app/black-box-systest-dmp-main-${project.version}.jar
----

Note that `${project.version}` will be replaced with the actual project version by maven at build time.

On a side note - with the entrypoint defined this way in the docker image,
arguments given to a container, when created with this image,
will be passed as arguments to the project's Main JAR file,
and hence accessible as command-line arguments in `ProjectMain.java`.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]

include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=application-test-image-entrypoint]
----


===== Application Test Image - Putting it All Together

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=application-test-image]
----


===== HelloIT Test

Placing the test file, `HelloIT`, under the project's `src/main/test` folder,
the Failsafe plugin matches the file based on the naming pattern `**/*IT.java`
and executes the test code within.

All methods marked with the `@Test` annotation are executed by Failsafe.

Note the use of RestAssured for a fairly easy way to build the
client call to our service.

[,java,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/src/test/java/com/savoirtech/blog/systest/it/HelloIT.java[tag=test-hello-endpoint]
----

Note the use of `System.getProperty("application.base-url");` in the test method.
That property is injected by the Failsafe plugin using the following section under the plugin's `<configuration>` tag:

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=failsafe-plugin-system-properties]
----

Notice the following line:

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
<value>http://localhost:${application-http-port}</value>
----

That ties in the dynamically-allocated, ephemeral, port from docker,
which is significant for minimizing environment-specific failures,
such as attempting to build on a machine where the developer has other
applications listening on the same ports.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=application-test-image-ports]
----

Notice the left side of the `:` in the port declaration is `application-http-port`,
which informs the docker-maven-plugin to dynamically allocate a host port
and then populate a Maven property of the same name with that port number for its value.
The number on the right side of the `:` is the container's internal port number -
8080 in this case, the port number on which our application is listening for web requests.

The commented-out `5005:5005` port mapping is a convenience to simplify
the effort needed to debug the application while it is running inside the container.
Uncommenting this line grants access to the applications debug port inside the container
from the host port 5005.
Note that the image is also created with `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` configured
with debugging enabled for the application.


===== Handling Errors in the Test

Once integration tests have completed,
it is important to inform Maven of failures.
This is not done automatically,
so we need to configure the plugin to do so.
Here is the boilerplate that goes in the
`executions` section of the `maven-failsafe-plugin`.

[,xml,linenum,indent=0]
----
include::./project/docker-it/pom.xml[tag=failsafe-verify]
----

Without this, after tests fail, Maven will continue the build and ignore the failures.
Adding this section, Maven fails the build when there are test failures
(ignoring possible maven options to explicitly ignore failures).


=== Cleanup after Interrupted Tests

Imagine this - you're running the integration tests and notice a failure,
or remember that you forgot to finish that one thing that will make it all fail.
So you decide not to wait for the tests to complete.

So you hit Ctrl-C and stop the process during the integration-test phase.
Here's what you are left with:

* All of the containers successfully started by the `docker-maven-plugin` during the `pre-integration-test` phase continue to run
* The custom network used for the test remains
* Temporary volumes created by the plugin remain

Here are docker instructions that you can use to help with cleanup:

[,bash,linenum]
----
$ docker ps
$ docker stop a0b1c2d3
$ docker container rm a0b1c2d3
$ docker network ls
$ docker network rm projname-docker-it-network
$ docker volume ls
$ docker volume rm aa00bb11cc22...
----


=== Try it Out

[,bash,linenum]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/savoirtech/black-box-system-test-dmp.git
$ cd black-box-system-test-dmp
$ mvn -f project clean install
----


=== Author's Notes

* Initially, the plan was to include 1 external system dependency - such as a DB or JMS system - but due to the
length of the article, it was removed.
* JAX-RS was used in this example
** The main motivation is to avoid "vendor lock-in", and use the wider-reaching standard
** Spring's `@RestController` could just as easily have been used.
** There is additional boilerplate wiring for JAX-RS
* Always using `clean` in `mvn clean install`
** Maven will attempt incremental builds to save time
** There are many cases Maven does not catch, which leads to the incremental build being incorrect
** The amount of confusion and time to resolve these cases just isn't worth the savings *most* of the time
** If there are very slow parts of the build, such as the integration tests described in this article,
skipping them while iterating over the code, and then making sure to run them later - before commit and push -
is effective.
** The `install` target is ideal in most cases because it makes sure that working with a subset of the build -
such as running maven out of a sub-module's folder - gives the developer the expected, latest version of built
in-project dependencies.
** Feel free to use different targets as they suit your needs - just be aware of the potential pitfalls.
